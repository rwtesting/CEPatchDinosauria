  <description>Combat Extended compatibility patch for Dinosauria (b18).

Notes:
- Stun attacks from Dinosauria animals have temporarily been removed to avoid
  CE issue https://github.com/NoImageAvailable/CombatExtended/issues/375
- Added values needed by CE, including melee dodge, melee crit, armor penetration, and body shape.
- Adjusted armor values lower to be in line with CE (dinos have same armor relative to each other).  Dinos feels more fragile vs guns (but so do core animals).  May need to increase health scale.
- Dodge/Crit values are approximate, based on similar entities from the CE patch for Core animals and the a17 patch for Megafauna.  I categorized dinos based on the description and in-game pawn size, but the values may be off.

All body shapes are currently set to quadruped, except the birdlike dinos. I could not find a suitable biped shape for TRex/etc.
