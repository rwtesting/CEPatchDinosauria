Combat Extended compatibility patch for Dinosauria (b18).

Add values needed by CE, including melee dodge, melee crit, armor penetration, and body shape.

Values are approximate, based on similar entities from the CE patch for Core animals and the a17 patch for Megafauna.  I categorized dinos based on the description and in-game pawn size, but the values may be off.

All body shapes are currently set to quadruped (couldn't find a non-humanoid biped shape).
